# Research Plan: Evaluating Open Source Models for Student Python Competence Analysis

## Research Approach

My evaluation strategy focuses on identifying and testing open source models that can analyze Python code submissions and generate educational prompts for competence assessment. I will evaluate models across three categories: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code understanding, specialized code analysis tools, and educational assessment frameworks. The approach involves systematic testing with sample Python submissions ranging from basic syntax to advanced concepts, measuring each model's ability to identify conceptual gaps, generate meaningful prompts, and provide pedagogically sound feedback without revealing solutions.

For practical evaluation, I will implement a testing pipeline that feeds student code samples to candidate models and analyzes their outputs against predefined criteria including accuracy of concept identification, quality of generated prompts, educational value of feedback, and computational efficiency. This will involve creating a benchmark dataset of Python code with known competence indicators, developing evaluation metrics for prompt quality, and conducting comparative analysis across models to identify the most suitable option for educational deployment.

## Model Evaluation and Selection

After researching available options, I've identified **CodeT5+** (Salesforce's code-understanding model) as the most promising candidate for this use case. CodeT5+ offers several advantages: it's specifically trained on code understanding tasks, has strong performance on Python analysis, provides interpretable outputs suitable for educational contexts, and maintains a reasonable computational footprint for practical deployment. The model can analyze code structure, identify patterns and anti-patterns, understand semantic relationships in code, and generate contextual explanations.

To validate CodeT5+'s applicability, I would test it with diverse Python submissions including basic syntax exercises, algorithm implementations, object-oriented programming examples, and error-prone code patterns. The validation process would measure its ability to correctly identify conceptual understanding levels, generate prompts that encourage deeper thinking, detect common misconceptions in student code, and provide feedback that guides without revealing answers. Additionally, I would compare its outputs against human expert assessments to ensure educational validity and test its performance across different skill levels to verify adaptability.

## Reasoning Answers

**What makes a model suitable for high-level competence analysis?**
A suitable model must possess deep code comprehension capabilities to understand not just syntax but semantic intent and design patterns. It needs pedagogical awareness to generate educationally appropriate prompts that scaffold learning progressively. The model should demonstrate nuanced assessment abilities, distinguishing between surface-level mistakes and fundamental misconceptions. Finally, it must maintain interpretability, providing clear reasoning for its assessments that educators can verify and students can understand.

**How would you test whether a model generates meaningful prompts?**
Testing prompt meaningfulness requires multi-faceted evaluation including alignment with learning objectives, cognitive load assessment, student engagement metrics, and learning outcome measurement. I would conduct A/B testing comparing model-generated prompts with expert-created ones, analyze student response patterns to identify which prompts lead to breakthrough understanding, measure the depth of reasoning in student responses to different prompt types, and track long-term retention and transfer of concepts prompted by the model.

**What trade-offs might exist between accuracy, interpretability, and cost?**
The primary trade-offs involve model complexity versus explainability (larger models may be more accurate but less interpretable), computational resources versus response time (more sophisticated analysis requires more processing), generalization versus specialization (models trained specifically on educational data may be more appropriate but less versatile), and deployment complexity versus maintenance overhead (simpler models are easier to deploy but may require more manual intervention).

**Why did you choose CodeT5+ and what are its strengths/limitations?**
I selected CodeT5+ because it balances code understanding capability with practical deployment considerations. Its strengths include specialized training on code tasks giving it superior understanding of programming concepts, ability to generate both analytical outputs and natural language explanations, moderate size making it deployable on standard infrastructure, and open-source availability with active community support. However, its limitations include potential gaps in understanding highly advanced or unconventional coding patterns, need for fine-tuning on educational assessment data for optimal performance, limited context window compared to larger LLMs, and requirement for additional prompt engineering to generate pedagogically optimal outputs.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Model Setup**: Install CodeT5+ and required dependencies, configure for Python code analysis tasks
2. **Data Preparation**: Create test dataset with varied Python submissions, annotate with competence indicators
3. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Develop automated testing framework, implement metric calculation systems
4. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt model for educational context using transfer learning on educational code datasets
5. **Validation**: Conduct pilot testing with real student submissions, gather feedback from educators
6. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive usage guides and best practices for educational deployment
